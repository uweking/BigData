some of the files in this package are just for debugging purposes.
The only interesting ones are the valueSimulator.py and the main.py.
main.py is for managing all the mqtt communication and the valueSimulator is for simulating the data.
In the current state, both of them are not compatible out of the box and need some adjustments in order to work together.
